    <string name="avery_mens_basement">The largest bathroom for men in Avery, this bathroom boasts seven stalls(two handicap), three urinals, and four sinks.
    In between classes this bathroom becomes very busy, causing it to be quite messy at times. What do I mean by messy? Sometimes you go into a stall and it looks like
    teenagers were TP-ing a house that wouldn\'t give them candy on Halloween. Because of the amount of traffic, this bathroom gets 3 stars in spite of it\'s large amount
    of amenities.</string>
